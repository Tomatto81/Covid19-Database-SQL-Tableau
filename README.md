🚀 How to Use

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/Tomatto81/Covid19-Database-SQL-Tableau

Import data from CovidDeaths.xlsx and CovidVaccinations.xlsx into the SQL database.

Run the SQL scripts available in the Data Exploration COVID19.sql file to clean and process the data.

Export the processed data from SQL to Excel files, as Tableau Public does not support direct SSMS connections.
